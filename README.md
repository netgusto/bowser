# bowser - Browser switch

Bowser is a MacOS application that selects the browser to open for a URL based on rules you define.

My use case is to have 2 default browsers : one for development (Chrome), and one for surf (Safari).

## Install from binary releases

TODO

## Install from source

The installation from source requires the Apple clang environment (XCode) and Go 1.8+

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/netgusto/bowser
$ cd bowser
$ make install
```

## Setup as default browser
